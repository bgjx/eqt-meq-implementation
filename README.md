# eqt-meq-implementation

Automatic data cleansing, annotations, and training in implementing EQTransformer deep learning for microearthquake automatic phase picking.

This module covers the detailed process of:
- Microearthquake data cleansing process.
- Catalog creation and seismogram data annotations.
- Model training using EQTransformer
- Model predictions.
- Post picking refinement.
- Data associations for NonLinLoc ready.
- and detailed results in real microearthquake monitoring in Geothermal field.
