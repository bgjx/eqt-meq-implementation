# eqt-meq-implementation

This module covers automatic data cleansing, annotation, and training for implementing the EQTransformer deep learning model in automatic microearthquake phase picking.

This module covers the detailed process of:
- Microearthquake data cleansing process.
- Catalog creation and seismogram data annotations.
- Model training using EQTransformer
- Model predictions.
- Post picking refinement.
- Data associations for NonLinLoc ready.
- and detailed results in real microearthquake monitoring in Geothermal field.
